            <p>Lately, I have been thinking a lot about the gap between learning and doing. Many university students today come out of their degrees with strong theoretical knowledge but often without projects that truly demonstrate their skills. They have learned concepts and frameworks but have not had the chance or taken the initiative to build something real. I realized that if I wanted to be truly ready for the professional world, I needed to stop passively consuming tutorials and start creating. This portfolio project is about getting my hands dirty, proving to myself that starting is the most important thing, and reigniting the ambition I have been feeling lately.</p>

            <h2>Facing the Gap Between Theory and Practice</h2>
            <p>Throughout my studies, I sometimes felt like I was just going through the motions. Watching tutorials, doing exercises, and completing assignments gave me knowledge but not confidence. I noticed how easy it is to consume content endlessly without ever building something substantial.</p>

            <p>The professional world can be intimidating. Job postings often ask for a mix of skills including full-stack development, cloud computing, and machine learning. It is easy to get discouraged when the stories about competition and high expectations pile up. I realized that the only way to overcome that fear is to start building, even if it is messy at first. Each project I create will be a step toward bridging the gap between theory and practice.</p>

            <h2>Organising the Portfolio</h2>
            <p>I’m planning to structure the portfolio to showcase:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Full-Stack Projects:</strong> Web apps that combine frontend, backend, and database work.</li>
                <li><strong>Cloud & DevOps:</strong> Projects demonstrating deployment, CI/CD pipelines, and cloud integration.</li>
                <li><strong>Machine Learning</strong>: Experiments and models that highlight my data science skills.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
            <p>Each week, I'll not only highlight progress I have made to my current project, but also key learning and takeaways I have made along the way. This week it has been:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Start before you feel ready. Confidence comes from building, not waiting.</li>
                <li>Action beats perfection. Progress is made through iteration, not endless planning.</li>
                <li>Ambition is essential. If you do not set high goals, you will never know how far you can go.</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>This portfolio is more than just a website; it’s a space for experimentation, growth, and showcasing the skills I’m building in real time. What began as a stressful “do I know enough?” question is turning into a project I’m genuinely excited to share with the world.</p>
